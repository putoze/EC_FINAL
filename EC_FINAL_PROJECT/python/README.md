### To Execute Our code
```
python ev3a.py --input ev3a_example.cfg
```
### Some Notes
1. Change into non-self_adaptive mutate(INT8)<br />
2. Change crossoverFraction into INT8<br />
3. Write individual into txt file<br />
4. Write Self-energy, interact-energy into txt file<br /> 
5. Try INT8 precision in python code before designing verilog code<br />

### Test.py
&emsp;&emsp;If you done your verilog code, you can write the data into txt file, then put into python to check it correction .
