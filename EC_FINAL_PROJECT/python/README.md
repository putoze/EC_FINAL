# EV3a 

## Notes
&emsp;&emsp;Before you start to do this project. Some background knowledge you must need to know. First thing you have to know is what is "Evalution Calculation". I stronggly suggest you to have the class first. Second thing is some hardware accelerate skill. For example, pipelining, caching and so on. Wish you have a good time for learning it~~

## Some good Notes for you to implement on hardware

1. Change into non-self_adaptive mutate<br />
2. Change all random variable into INT8<br />
3. Write individual into txt file<br />
4. Write Self-energy, interact-energy into txt file<br /> 
5. Try INT8 precision in python code before designing verilog code<br />
6. If you done your verilog code, you can write the data into txt file, then put into python to check it correction. For example, my Test.py file, it is used for testing my Evaluate fitness verilog file.

## To Execute Our code
```
python ev3a.py --input ev3a_example.cfg
```
