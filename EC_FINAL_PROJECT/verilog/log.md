1. we can merge evaluate fitness and self adaptive mutate into evaulate fitness module <br />
2. TESBED has already done, if you want to know the input result, please read wave file input png first. <br />
3. RF module can accelerate if we combine conduct_tournment and crossover <br />
4. RF module can accelerate if we combine combinePops and truncateSelect <br />
5. we need to think how can we do evaluateFitness before combinePops and truncateSelect and only use one evaluateFitness. <br />
6. Improve evaluate fitness in my python code, please read my Evaluator python code first. <br /> 
7. I want to merge POP_RF into EV3a module <br />
------------------------
12/7 <br />
1. finish our final proposal <br />
2. revise our in-out interface <br />
3. LFSR delete mode <br />
4. should I add some random seed input in my EV3a ? <br />

------------------------
12/17<br />
1. finish our final verilog code <br />
2. PPT start to do it <br />
3. If we have time, we can add self adaptive mutate in currentStateMU == TOURMENT. <br />
4. Revise data path, maybe try to use Inkscape. <br />
